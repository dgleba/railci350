/*
  Customize RailsAdmin theme here.
  Copy this file to your app/assets/stylesheets/rails_admin/custom/theming.scss, leave this one untouched
  Don't require it in your application.rb

  Look at the markup in RailsAdmin and go there to get inspiration from:

  http://getbootstrap.com

  Test me: (actual color should be the one defined in variables.scss if you did)

  body { background-color: $link-color; }
  
  .content{
  width: 88%;
  }

  

didn't work:
 Make sidebar nave narrower 

.col-md-10{
width: 90%;
}
.col-md-offset-2{
width: 10%;
}
.sidebar-nav{
  width: 10%;
}
end Make sidebar nave narrower
